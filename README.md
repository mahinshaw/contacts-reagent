Contacts-Reagent
================

This is based on [Address-Book](http://www.jarrodctaylor.com/posts/Compojure-Address-Book-Part-1/).
It used reagent for the front end, and visually creates the same layout. It was an attempt to build
something simple with reagent. I imagine there are a number of practices that I did not take into
account with building this, so please, tell me what could be done more efficiently.
